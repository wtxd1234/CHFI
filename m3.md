## **CHFI Module 3: Understanding Hard Disks and File Systems**

---

### **Key Topics from Module 3**

#### **Understanding Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
1. **Structure:**
   - **Tracks:** Concentric circles on the platter where data is stored.
   - **Sectors:** Divisions within a track, each storing a fixed amount of data.
   - **4K Sectors:** Advanced format providing larger sector sizes for better efficiency.
2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Data transfer rate.
   - Latency and seek time.
   - RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).

---

#### **Understanding Solid-State Drive (SSD)**
- Utilizes NAND flash memory.
- No moving parts, leading to faster data access and durability.
- Common interfaces: SATA, NVMe.

### **File Systems**
| **File System**     | **Key Features**                                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FAT (File Allocation Table)** | Basic, limited partition size, widely supported.                       |
| **FAT32**           | Larger partition support, suitable for portable devices.               |
| **NTFS (New Technology File System)** | Advanced security, journaling, large file and volume size.        |
| **EXT (Extended File System)** | Linux file system with journaling support in ext3/ext4.                  |
| **APFS (Apple File System)** | Optimized for macOS, supports snapshots and encryption.                   |

---

#### **Key NTFS Features**
- **Master File Table (MFT):** Central database storing metadata about files.
- **Cluster Sizes:** Allocated storage units; smaller sizes reduce waste but increase overhead.
- **Sparse Files:** Efficient storage for large files with lots of zero data.

### **RAID Storage Systems**
| **RAID Level**       | **Key Features**                             | **Use Cases**                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **RAID 0**           | Striping, no redundancy, high speed.         | High-performance applications. |
| **RAID 1**           | Mirroring for data redundancy.               | Critical data storage.         |
| **RAID 5**           | Striping with parity, balanced performance.  | Balanced performance/redundancy. |
| **RAID 6**           | Dual parity for enhanced fault tolerance.    | Large, critical systems.       |
| **RAID 10 (1+0)**    | Combination of striping and mirroring.       | High redundancy and performance. |

### **Storage Area Network (SAN)**
- High-speed network providing centralized storage to multiple devices.
- Key components: Fiber Channel, iSCSI.

### **Character Encoding Standards**
| **Standard** | **Description**                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **ASCII**    | Basic character encoding for text.               |
| **Unicode**  | Universal encoding supporting multiple languages.|
