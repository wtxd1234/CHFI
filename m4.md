## **CHFI Module 4: Data Acquisition and Duplication**

---

### **Key Topics in Module 4**

#### **Data Acquisition Fundamentals**
- Process of collecting digital evidence for forensic investigation.
- Includes capturing both volatile (temporary) and non-volatile (permanent) data.
- Key principles:
  - Maintain evidence integrity.
  - Follow a systematic methodology.

---

### **Rules of Thumb for Data Acquisition**
1. **Prioritize Volatile Data:**
   - Start with volatile data like RAM and network state.
   - Follow the **Order of Volatility (RFC 3227)**:
     - Registers → Cache → RAM → Network state → Disk storage.
2. **Minimize Alteration:**
   - Use write blockers.
   - Document all actions thoroughly.

### **Types of Data Acquisition**
| **Type**        | **Description**                                                                            | **Tools**                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Live Data**    | Captures data from running systems, such as RAM and network connections.                   | FTK Imager, Wireshark, DumpIt |
| **Dead Data**    | Collects data from powered-off devices. Bit-for-bit imaging ensures no data alteration.    | FTK Imager, EnCase, dd        |

### **Data Acquisition Formats**
| **Format**                  | **Details**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw Format**              | Uncompressed bit-for-bit copy.                                             |
| **Proprietary Format**      | Includes metadata, requires specific software to access.                   |
| **Advanced Forensic Format (AFF)** | Open format with metadata for verification and multi-user analysis.          |

### **Data Acquisition Methodology**
1. **Determine Best Method:**
   - Logical Acquisition: For specific files or structures.
   - Sparse Acquisition: For deleted files or specific disk sectors.
   - Physical Imaging: Comprehensive bit-for-bit copy.
2. **Select Tools:**
   - Commercial: EnCase, FTK Imager.
   - Open-source: The Sleuth Kit, Autopsy, dd.
3. **Sanitize Target Media:**
   - Ensure the target storage is clean before use.
4. **Acquire Volatile Data:**
   - Capture RAM, running processes, and network states.
5. **Enable Write Protection:**
   - Use hardware/software write blockers to prevent modifications.
6. **Acquire Non-Volatile Data:**
   - Create forensic images of hard drives and RAID systems.
7. **Plan for Contingency:**
   - Have backups for tools and devices.
8. **Validate Acquisition:**
   - Verify the integrity of acquired data using hash functions.

### **Live Data Acquisition Tools**
| **Tool**        | **Description**                                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FTK Imager**   | Captures RAM and creates forensic images.                        |
| **Wireshark**    | Analyzes real-time network traffic.                               |
| **DumpIt**       | Simple memory dump utility for Windows.                          |
| **LiME**         | Linux memory extractor for capturing RAM contents.               |

---

### **Dead Data Acquisition**
1. **Bit Stream Image:**
   - Creates an exact replica of the storage device.
   - Includes deleted files and unused space.
2. **Methods:**
   - **Physical Imaging:** Entire drive contents, including hidden sectors.
   - **Logical Imaging:** Specific data or file system structures.

---

### **Key Concepts**
- **Chain of Custody:** Documents every handler of the evidence to ensure its integrity.
- **Write Protection:** Prevents accidental modification of evidence.
- **Validation:** Hashing ensures data authenticity and integrity.
