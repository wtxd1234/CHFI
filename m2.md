## **CHFI Module 2: Computer Forensics Investigation Process**

---

### **Key Points from CHFI Module 2**

#### **Quick Summary from Module 1**
- Overview of computer forensics.
- Importance of digital evidence.
- Incident response processes.
- Cybercrime laws in the USA and other countries.

---

### **Forensic Investigation Process**
1. **Steps:**
   - **Examination:** Initial review of suspicious activities or evidence.
   - **Hypothesis Formulation:** Understanding potential causes or scenarios.
   - **Investigation:** Gathering and analyzing data to validate hypotheses.
   - **Tool Selection:** Using appropriate forensic tools for data analysis.
   - **Result Review:** Summarizing findings and their implications.
   - **Conclusion:** Finalizing results and reporting.

2. **Case Study:** Sarah detects unfamiliar transactions and traces them to a phishing email through systematic investigation.

---

### **Building the Investigation Team**
- Roles include first responders, forensic analysts, and legal consultants.
- Requires collaboration and defined protocols for evidence handling.

---

### **First Response by Laboratory Forensics Staff**
- **Document Scene:** Photograph, sketch, and record initial evidence.
- **Secure Scene:** Prevent contamination or alteration of evidence.
- **Evaluate Devices:** Assess powered-on, powered-off, or networked systems.

### **Evidence Handling**
| **Stage**                 | **Details**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Evidence Preservation** | Ensure integrity of evidence using tools like write-blockers.               |
| **Chain of Custody**       | Maintain a documented history of evidence handling to ensure authenticity. |
| **Packaging**              | Use tamper-proof containers and proper labeling.                          |
| **Transport/Storage**      | Securely transport and store evidence in controlled environments.          |

---

### **Dealing with Devices**
1. **Powered-On Devices:**
   - Capture volatile data like RAM contents.
   - Record system state before shutdown.
2. **Powered-Off Devices:**
   - Avoid powering on; extract data using forensic imaging tools.
3. **Networked Devices:**
   - Monitor network activity and isolate compromised systems.

### **Data Acquisition**
| **Method**           | **Description**                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Forensic Imaging**  | Creating exact replicas of drives to analyze data.       |
| **Live Acquisition**  | Extracting data from powered-on devices.                 |

---

### **Data Analysis**
- Use forensic tools (e.g., EnCase, FTK) to:
  - Extract metadata.
  - Recover deleted files.
  - Analyze logs for suspicious activities.

---

### **Reporting and Presentation**
1. **Writing the Investigation Report:**
   - Include objectives, methods, findings, and conclusions.
   - Ensure clarity, accuracy, and admissibility in court.
2. **Expert Witness Role:**
   - Present findings credibly.
   - Answer technical questions during legal proceedings.

---

### **Preventive Measures**
- Regular system audits and training.
- Implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Awareness of phishing and social engineering tactics.
